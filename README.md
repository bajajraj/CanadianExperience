# CanadianExperience
This game is made on Clion Platform. 
The Graphical User Interface for this project is wxWidgets. It was chosen becuase of its great compatibility. 

In the game, there is a move mode, where the mouse grabs the character and moves him around. The body moves when you click on any part except the head. The head moves with the body, but you can also move it independently.

In rotate mode, all of the body parts rotate. The child parts rotate with the parent parts.

We are, of course, creating a scene from the great country of Canada. If you’ve seen South Park, you’ll know what I’m talking about.

This is what the final project looks like -
